# LD-32
Ludum Dare 32 - Jam


- Download the LD32-Distrib folder and run the LD32.exe inside to play.

- Can also run by dragging the Game folder over (a shortcut to) love.exe (found in LOVE folder)


- There are instructions for running on different OS here: https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution


- Was able to just finish the gameplay mechanics in time before deadline
- No score or levels at the moment, just bounce around and crash into aliens

- Move with A / D
- Jump with W

- Source is a mess, might come back and clean up if I find time
